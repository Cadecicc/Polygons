# Polygons
Run the program using whichever Java development enviroment you like. This project was made in Eclipse.

# How to Use
Left-click anywhere in the GUI box to create a vertex for a new shape. Once you have all desired vertices, right click to create a new polygon. If you want the shape to be filled with the vertex and line color, hold down the shift key when right-clicking.

# Load Data
If there is already a poly.dat file created, clicking the "Load Data" button will fill in the GUI with the polygons from that file.

# Save Data
To save the current polygons, click the "Save Data" button to override the poly.dat file. If there is no poly.dat file present, it will create a new one and fill it with the current polygons.

# Clear
To clear the screen of all polygons, click the "Clear" button.
